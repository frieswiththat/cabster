Risks and Technical Debts 
=========================

## Technical Debt

1. *No DB Migrations specified*: Currently, the Database is not being set up with migrations. To set up the Database automatically and make changing the schemas easier, an automated migration tool (for example, *marv* for Lambdas) should be used.
2. *No connection pooling*: DB connections will not scale as they are implemented. A proxy or pooling service should be used instead.  


## Risks

1. *No exit strategy*: Currently, for the MVP, AWS is assumed. Some Services (core) can be easily migrated, but not all have explicit alternatives in place
