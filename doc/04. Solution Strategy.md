Solution Strategy
=================

*Platform*: AWS
This system will be implemented on AWS, since an account there is available on short notice, as well as the expertise to implement it. AWS provides all the functionality needed for this application. A pivot to another Cloud Provider would be technically feasible and architecturally irrelevant for the core Application, but would require implementation expertise not available on short notice. Care is taken, however, to reduce vendor lock-in where possible.

*Architectural Pattern*: Service-oriented serverless
The architecture will consist of multiple, platform-provided services where appropriate (message queueing, asset message brokering) and a portable core of business logic. The Application exists as a microservice (Ride data collection and receipt generation) in the bigger context of Cabster's application infrastructure.

*Quality goal assurance*: Managed services and autoscaling
Where appropriate, highly available and -reliable managed services are used. Core services are decoupled with concessions made to enable recovery from nonavailability, and enabled to auto scale with demand.
